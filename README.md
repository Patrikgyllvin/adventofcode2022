#Template for the Advent of Code challenge.

## Usage
Run `make` to build all. To run, run e.g `make bin/1/1` to create and run an executable.

The script `util/pull-input.sh` can be used together with a `secret/cookies.txt` file to download the challenges and setup a template. `pull-input.sh root_dir [day [year]]`.
